# Proposals & Enhancements

Issues that contain new feature ideas or important enhancements are labelled with `kind/proposal`

As written in the [PR Guidelines](./pr_guidelines.md), contributors should always write such proposals prior to submitting a PR so they can discuss with maintainers about not only the design and code standards for the PR itself, but also the feature. 
Contributors can still accompany PRs with a proposal to provide a proof of concept or prototype.

## Proposals and Workflow

During the triage process, proposals should be assigned a time frame to allow community members to express their opinion, and maintainers to refine the need and fully understand the scope of the feature being discussed.

Once the time frame is over, maintainers will document their decision to either: 
- accept the proposal
- reject and close the proposal
- extend the time needed to refine it

## Re-Opening a proposal

Closed proposals can be re-opened whenever there is notable activity from the community. 
This happens during the triage process.
